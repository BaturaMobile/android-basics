# MoveTilt

## Updating libraries (:core, :mvp, :mvvmi)
When we will want update **core** library, we must also update the rest of the libraries defined in this project that have dependencies on it. (e.g.: *mvp* or *mvvmi*)
With this, we make sure that they are always up-to-date and have compatibility with the *core* library.
